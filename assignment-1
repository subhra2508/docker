assignment : manage multiple container

run a nginx , a mysql, and a httpd(apache) server
run all of them --detach or (-d) ,name them with --name
nginx should listen on 80:80,httpd on 8080:80, mysql on 3306:3306
when running mqsql,use the --env option(-e) to pass in MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=yes
use docker container logs on mysql to find the random password it created on startup
clean it all up with docker container stop and docker container rm (both can accept multiple names or id's)
use docker container ls to ensure everything is correct before and after cleanup
