DNS RR TEST:
- ever since docker engine 1.11 , we can have multiple containers on a created network respond to the same DNS address
- create a new virtual network(default bridge driver)
- create two containers from elasticsearch:2 image
- research and use --network-alias search when creating them to give them an additional DNS name to respond to
- run alpine nslookup search with --net to see the two containers list for the same DNS name

- run centos curl -s search:9200 with --net multiple times until you see both "name" fields show
